<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repository contains the code and data files for a Machine Learning project aimed  developing a time series regression model to accurately predict the unit sales of various items sold at Corporation Favorita's stores across different locations in Ecuador. The model aims to optimize inventory management by forecasting future demand, enabling the company to maintain optimal stock levels and minimize both overstocking and understocking situations.. 

Features
The key attributes in the dataset include:

Store_nbr : identifies the store at which the products are sold. 

Family: identifies the type of product sold.

Sales: gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).

Onpromotion :gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.
